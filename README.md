# 🚢 Titanic Survival Classification

This project applies a complete data science workflow to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. It includes data cleaning, exploration, and model training with evaluation. The goal is to demonstrate practical data science skills in a real-world classification task.

## 📊 Project Overview

- ✅ Cleaned and preprocessed raw dataset
- 📈 Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Seaborn
- 🏷️ Encoded categorical features (Sex, Embarked)
- 🤖 Model training: Logistic Regression & Random Forest
- 📉 Model evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
- 📊 Visual model comparison

## 📁 Files

- `Ttitanic_classification.ipynb`: Full notebook with explanations and code
- `train_and_test2.csv`: Cleaned Titanic dataset used for modeling
- `README.md`: This file

## 📦 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Results

Both Logistic Regression and Random Forest performed well. Random Forest showed slightly better accuracy, benefiting from non-linear relationships in the features.

## ✅ Next Steps

- Feature engineering: extract titles from names, create family size, etc.
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Save and deploy model with joblib
